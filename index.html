<b>What is a Magic 8-Ball?</b>
<p>
The real-life 3D version of the Magic 8 Ball is a shiny plastic sphere made in the likeness of the most important billiard ball:
striking, dramatic, iconic number 8. Nestled in the centermost position of the triangle, significant and 
magical number 8 is the lone ball which does not have a mate. Every other ball in the game is one-half of a matched set; 
each color is expressed as a pair made up of one solid ball and one striped ball. </p>

<p>The primary significance of the 8 ball 
is due to its placement in the exact middle of the rack, in between solid colors (numbers 1 through 7) and striped balls 
(numbers 9 through 15). The powerful 8 ball can unexpectedly cause any player to win or lose the game in an instant, and
thus it has become a symbol of fortune and chance.</p>

<p>Abe Bookman of the Alabe Crafts Company of Cincinnati introduced Magic 
8 Ball to the world in 1946. Originally, he marketed it as a decorative paperweight, although after he saw its popularity 
with children, he re-released the novelty item as a toy.
For over 75 years, the Magic 8 Ball has retained its original paperweight design of a perfect sphere with one flat edge to rest 
on a desk. It contains a 20-sided plastic polyhedron that floats in diluted liquid. Inscribed on each of its facets is a 
different answer to a yes-or-no question.</p>
<p>The IRL physical version of the Magic 8 Ball requires the user to shake it for an answer, but our handy version above 
simply requires a click.</p>
